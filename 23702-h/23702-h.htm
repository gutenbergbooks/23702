    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A short, square chunk of a man walked into a shipping office on the East
      Side, and inquired for the Manager of the Line. He had kindly blue eyes, a
      stub nose, and a mouth that shut to like a rat-trap, and stayed shut.
      Under his chin hung a pair of half-moon whiskers which framed his
      weather-beaten face as a spike collar frames a dog's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to send this vessel to sea again,&rdquo; blurted out the chunk.
      &ldquo;She ought to go to the dry-dock. Her boats haven't had a brushful of
      paint for a year; her boilers are caked clear to her top flues, and her
      pumps won't take care of her bilge water. Charter something else and lay
      her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Manager turned in his revolving chair and faced him. He was the
      opposite of the Captain in weight, length, and thickness&mdash;a slim,
      well-groomed, puffy-cheeked man of sixty with a pair of uncertain, badly
      aimed eyes and a voice like the purr of a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Captain, you surely don't mean what you say. She is perfectly
      seaworthy and sound. Just look at her inspection&mdash;&rdquo; and he passed him
      the certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don't want to see it! I know 'em by heart: it's a lie,
      whatever it says. Give an inspector twenty dollars and he's stone blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Manager laughed softly. He had handled too many rebellious captains in
      his time; they all had a protest of some kind&mdash;it was either the
      crew, or the grub, or the coal, or the way she was stowed. Then he added
      softly, more as a joke than anything else:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not afraid, are you, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A crack started from the left-hand corner of the Captain's mouth, crossed
      a fissure in his face, stopped within half an inch of his stub nose, and
      died out in a smile of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I'm afraid of is neither here nor there. There's cattle aboard&mdash;that
      is, there will be by to-morrow night; and there's a lot of passengers
      booked, some of 'em women and children. It isn't honest to ship 'em and
      you know it! As to her boilers send for the Chief Engineer. He'll tell
      you. You call it taking risks; I call it murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I understand you refuse to obey the orders of the Board?&mdash;and
      yet she's got to sail on the 16th if she sinks outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I refuse to obey the orders of the Board I'll tell the Board, not
      you. And when I do tell 'em I'll tell 'em something else, and that is,
      that this chartering of worn-out tramps, painting 'em up and putting 'em
      into the Line, has got to stop, or there'll be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this will be her last trip, Captain. Then we'll overhaul her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard that lie for a year. She'll run as long as they can insure her
      and her cargo. As for the women and children, I suppose they don't count&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he turned on his heel and left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way out he met the Chief Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do the best you can, Mike,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;orders are we sail on the 16th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the fourth day out this conversation took place in the smoking-room
      between a group of passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular tub, this ship!&rdquo; growled the Man-Who-Knew-It-All to the Bum
      Actor. &ldquo;Screw out of the water every souse she makes; lot of dirty sailors
      skating over the decks instead of keeping below where they belong; Chief
      Engineer loafing in the Captain's room every chance he gets&mdash;there he
      goes now&mdash;and it's the second time since breakfast. And the Captain
      is no better! And just look at the accommodations&mdash;three stewards and
      a woman! What's that to look after thirty-five passengers? Half the time I
      have to wait an hour to get something to eat&mdash;such as it is. And my
      bunk wasn't made up yesterday until plumb night. That bunch in the
      steerage must be having a hard time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get all we pay for,&rdquo; essayed the Travelling Man. &ldquo;She ain't rigged for
      cabin passengers, and the Captain don't want 'em. Didn't want to take me&mdash;except
      our folks had a lot of stuff aboard. Had enough passengers, he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he took the widow and her two kids&rdquo;&mdash;continued the
      Man-Who-Knew-It-All&mdash;&ldquo;and they were the last to get aboard. Half the
      time he's playing nurse instead of looking after his ship. Had 'em all on
      the bridge yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>had</i> to take 'em,&rdquo; protested the Travelling Man. &ldquo;She was put
      under his charge by his owners&mdash;so one of the stewards told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;<i>had to</i>, did he! Yes&mdash;I've been there before. No use
      talking&mdash;this line's got to be investigated, and I'm going to do the
      investigating as soon as I get ashore, and don't you forget it! What's
      your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bum Actor made no reply. He had been cold and hungry too many days and
      nights to find fault with anything. But for the generosity of a few
      friends he would still be tramping the streets, sleeping where he could.
      Three meals a day&mdash;four, if he wanted them&mdash;and a bed in a room
      all to himself instead of being one in a row of ten, was heaven to him.
      What the Captain, or the Engineer, or the crew, or anybody else did, was
      of no moment, so he got back alive. As to the widow's children, he had
      tried to pick up an acquaintance with them himself&mdash;especially the
      boy&mdash;but she had taken them away when she saw how shabby were his
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Texas Cattle Agent now spoke up. He was a tall, raw-boned man, with a
      red chin-whisker and red, weather-scorched face, whose clothing looked as
      if it had been pulled out of shape in the effort to accommodate itself to
      the spread of his shoulders and round of his thighs. His trousers were
      tucked in his boots, the straps hanging loose. He generally sat by himself
      in one corner of the cramped smoking-room, and seldom took part in the
      conversation. The Bum Actor and he had exchanged confidences the night
      before, and the Texan therefore felt justified in answering in his
      friend's stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're way off, friend,&rdquo; he said to the Man-Who-Knew-It-All. &ldquo;There ain't
      nothin' the matter with the Line, nor the ship, nor the Captain. This is
      my sixth trip aboard of her, and I know! They had a strike among the
      stevedores the day we sailed, and then, too, we've got a scrub lot of
      stokers below, and the Captain's got to handle 'em just so. That kind gets
      ugly when anything happens. I had sixty head of cattle aboard here on my
      last trip over, and some of 'em got loose in a storm, and there was hell
      to pay with the crew till things got straightened out. I ain't much on
      shootin' irons, but they came handy that time. I helped and I know. Got a
      couple in my cabin now. Needn't tell me nothin' about the Captain. He's
      all there when he's wanted, and it don't take him more'n a minute, either,
      to get busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the smoking-room opened and the object of his eulogy strolled
      in. He was evidently just off the bridge, for the thrash of the spray
      still glistened on his oilskins and on his gray, half-moon whiskers. That
      his word was law aboard ship, and that he enforced it in the fewest words
      possible, was evident in every line of his face and every tone of his
      voice. If he deserved an overhauling it certainly would not come from any
      one on board&mdash;least of all from Carhart&mdash;the
      Man-Who-Knew-It-All.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosening the thong that bound his so'wester to his chin, he slapped it
      twice across a chair back, the water flying in every direction, and then
      faced the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bonner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the big-shouldered Texan, rising to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see you for a minute,&rdquo; and without another word the two men
      left the room and made their way in silence down the wet deck to where the
      Chief Engineer stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike, this is Mr. Bonner; you remember him, don't you? You can rely on
      his carrying out any orders you give him. If you need another man let him
      pick him out&mdash;&rdquo; and he continued on to his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once there the Captain closed the door behind him, shutting out the pound
      and swash of the sea; took from a rack over his bunk a roll of charts,
      spread one on a table and with his head in his hands studied it carefully.
      The door opened and the Chief Engineer again stood beside him. The Captain
      raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Bonner serve?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, glad to, and he thinks he's got another man. He's what he calls out
      his way a 'tenderfoot,' he says, but he's game and can be depended on.
      Have you made up your mind where she'll cross?&rdquo;&mdash;and he bent over the
      chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain picked up a pair of compasses, balanced them for a moment in
      his fingers, and with the precision of a seamstress threading a needle,
      dropped the points astride a wavy line known as the steamer track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer nodded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will give us about twenty-two hours leeway,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;if we
      make twelve knots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you make twelve knots: can you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say; depends on that gang of shovellers and the way they behave.
      They're a tough lot&mdash;jail-birds and tramps, most of 'em. If they get
      ugly there ain't but one thing left; that, I suppose, you won't object
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain paused for a moment in deep thought, glanced at the pin prick
      in the chart, and said with a certain forceful meaning in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not if there's no other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Engineer waited, as if for further reply, replaced his cap, and
      stepped out into the wind. He had got what he came for, and he had got it
      straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the closing of the door the Captain rolled up the chart, laid it in
      its place among the others, readjusted the thong of his so'wester, stopped
      for a moment before a photograph of his wife and child, looked at it long
      and earnestly, and then mounted the stairs to the bridge. With the
      exception that the line of his mouth had straightened and the knots in his
      eyebrows tightened, he was, despite the smoking-room critics, the same
      bluff, determined sea-dog who had defied the Manager the week before.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Bonner, half an hour later, returned to the smoking-room (he, too,
      had caught the splash of the sea, the spray drenching the rail), the Bum
      Actor crossed over and took the seat beside him. The Texan was the only
      passenger who had spoken to him since he came aboard, and he had already
      begun to feel lonely. This time he started the conversation by brushing
      the salt spray from the Agent's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got wet, didn't you? Too bad! Wait till I wipe it off,&rdquo; and he dragged a
      week-old handkerchief from his pocket. Then seeing that the Texan took no
      notice of the attention, he added, &ldquo;What did the Captain want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Texan did not reply. He was evidently absorbed in something outside
      his immediate surroundings, for he continued to sit with bent back, his
      elbows on his knees, his eyes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the question was repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the Captain want? Nothing the matter, is there?&rdquo; Fear had always
      been his master&mdash;fear of poverty mostly&mdash;and it was poverty in
      the worst form to others if he failed to get home. This thought had
      haunted him night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no. Don't worry&mdash;it'll all come out right. You seem
      nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. I've been through a lot and have almost reached the end of my rope.
      Have you got a wife at home?&rdquo; The Texan shook his head. &ldquo;Well, if you had
      you'd understand better than I can tell you. I have, and a three-year-old
      boy besides. I'd never have left them if I'd known. I came over under
      contract for a six months' engagement and we were stranded in Pittsburg
      and had hard work getting back to New York. Some of them are there yet.
      All I want now is to get home&mdash;nothing else will save them. Here's a
      letter from her I don't mind showing you&mdash;you can see for yourself
      what I'm up against. The boy never was strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big Texan read it through carefully, handed it back without a comment
      or word of sympathy, and then, with a glance around him, as if in fear of
      being overheard, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you keep your nerve in a mix-up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean a fight?&rdquo; queried the Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like fights&mdash;never did.&rdquo; Anything that would imperil his
      safe return was to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither&mdash;but sometimes you've got to. Are you handy with a gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;I'm only asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carhart, the Man-Who-Knew-It-All, here lounged over from his seat by the
      table and dropped into a chair beside them, cutting short his reply. The
      Texan gave a significant look at the Actor, enforcing his silence, and
      then buried his face in a newspaper a month old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carhart spread his legs, tilted his head back on the chair, slanted his
      stiff-brim hat until it made a thatch for his nose, and began one of his
      customary growls: to the room&mdash;to the drenched port-holes&mdash;to
      the brim of his hat; as a half-asleep dog sometimes does when things have
      gone wrong with him&mdash;or he dreams they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ship reminds me of another old tramp, the <i>Persia</i>,&rdquo; he
      drawled. &ldquo;Same scrub crew and same cut of a Captain. Hadn't been for two
      of the passengers and me, we'd never got anywhere. Had a fire in the lower
      hold in a lot of turpentine, and when they put that out we found her cargo
      had shifted and she was down by the head about six feet. Then the crew
      made a rush for the boats and left us with only four leaky ones to go a
      thousand miles. They'd taken 'em all, hadn't been for me and another
      fellow who stood over them with a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bum Actor raised his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo; he asked in a nervous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we pitched in and righted things and got into port at last. But the
      Captain was no good; he'd a-left with the crew if we'd let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the shifting of a cargo a serious matter?&rdquo; continued the Actor. &ldquo;This
      is my second crossing and I'm not much up on such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on the weather,&rdquo; interpolated a passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on how she's stowed,&rdquo; continued Car-hart. &ldquo;I've been mistrusting this
      ship ain't plumb on her keel. You can tell that from the way she falls off
      after each wave strikes her. I have been out on deck looking things over
      and she seems to me to be down by the stern more than she ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe she'll be lighter when more coal gets out of her,&rdquo; suggested
      another passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she's listed some to starboard. I watched her awhile this
      morning. She ain't loaded right, or she's loaded <i>wrong,-purpose</i>.
      That occurs sometimes with a gang of striking stevedores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noon whistle blew and the talk ended with the setting of everybody's
      watch, except the Bum Actor's, whose timepiece decorated a shop-window in
      the Bowery.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      That night one of those uncomfortable rumors, started doubtless by
      Carhart's talk, shivered through the ship, its vibrations even reaching
      the widow lying awake in her cabin. This said that some hundreds of
      barrels of turpentine had broken loose and were smashing everything below.
      If any one of them rolled into the furnaces an explosion would follow
      which would send them all to eternity. That this absurdity was immediately
      denied by the purser, who asserted with some vehemence that there was not
      a gallon of turpentine aboard, did not wholly allay the excitement, nor
      did it stifle the nervous anxiety which had now taken possession of the
      passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day wore on several additional rumors joined those already extant.
      One was dropped in the ear of the Texan by the Bum Actor as the two stood
      on the upper deck watching the sea, which was rapidly falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got so worried I thought I'd go down into the engine room myself,&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;I'm just back. Something's wrong down there, or I'm mistaken.
      I wish you'd go and find out. I knew that turpentine yarn was a lie, but I
      wanted to be sure, so I thought I'd ask one of the stokers who had come up
      for a little air. He was about to answer me when the Chief Engineer came
      down from the bridge, where he had been talking to the Captain, and
      ordered the man below before he had time to fill his lungs. I waited a
      little while, hoping he or some of the crew would come up again, and then
      I went down the ladder myself. When I got to the first landing I came bump
      up against the Chief Engineer. He was standing in the gangway fooling with
      a revolver he had in his hand as if he'd been cleaning it. 'I'll have to
      ask you to get back where you came from,' he said. 'This ain't no place
      for passengers'&mdash;and up I came. What do you think it means? I'd get
      ugly, too, if he kept me in that heat and never let me get a whiff of air.
      I tell you, that's an awful place down there. Suppose you go and take a
      look. Your knowing the Captain might make some difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any of the stokers around?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&mdash;none of them. I didn't see a
      soul but the Chief Engineer, and I didn't see him more than a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big Texan moved closer to the rail and again scrutinized the sky-line.
      He had kept this up all the morning, his eye searching the horizon as he
      moved from one side of the ship to the other. The inspection over, he
      slipped his arm through the Actor's and started him down the deck toward
      the Cattle Agent's cabin. When the two emerged the Texan's face still wore
      the look which had rested on it since the time the Captain had called him
      from the smoking-room. The Actor's countenance, however, had undergone a
      change. All his nervous timidity was gone; his lips were tightly drawn,
      the line of the jaw more determined. He looked like a man who had heard
      some news which had first steadied and then solidified him. These changes
      often overtake men of sensitive, highly strung natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back they encountered the Captain accompanied by the Chief
      Engineer. The two were heading for the saloon, the bugle having sounded
      for luncheon. As they passed by with their easy, swinging gait, the
      passengers watched them closely. If there was danger in the air these two
      officers, of all men, would know it. The Captain greeted the Texan with a
      significant look, waited until the Actor had been presented, looked the
      Texan's friend over from head to foot, and then with a nod to several of
      the others halted opposite a steamer chair in which sat the widow and her
      two children&mdash;one a baby and the other a boy of four&mdash;a plump,
      hugable little fellow, every inch of whose surface invited a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please stay a minute and let me talk to you, Captain,&rdquo; the widow pleaded.
      &ldquo;I've been so worried. None of these stories are true, are they? There
      can't be any danger or you would have told me&mdash;wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed heartily, so heartily that even the Chief Engineer
      looked at him in astonishment. &ldquo;What stories do you hear, my dear lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the steamer isn't loaded properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Captain laughed, this time under the curls of the chubby boy
      whom he had caught in his arms and was kissing eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not loaded right?&rdquo; he puffed at last when he got his breath. &ldquo;Well, well,
      what a pity! That yarn, I guess, comes from some of the navigators in the
      smoking-room. They generally run the ship. Here, you little rascal, turn
      out your toes and dance a jig for me. No&mdash;no&mdash;not that way&mdash;this
      way-r-out with them! Here, let me show you. One&mdash;two&mdash;off we go.
      Now the pigeon wing and the double twist and the rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat&mdash;that's
      the way, my lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the boy's hands now, the child shouting with laughter, the
      overjoyed mother clapping her hands as the big burly Captain with his face
      twice as red from the exercise, danced back and forth across the deck, the
      passengers forming a ring about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; sputtered the Captain, all out of breath from the exercise, as he
      dropped the child back into the widow's arms. &ldquo;Now all of you come down to
      luncheon. The weather is getting better every minute. The glass is rising
      and we are going to have a fine night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carhart, who had watched the whole performance with an ill-concealed sneer
      on his face, muttered to the man next him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you? He's a pretty kind of a Captain, ain't he? He's
      mashed on the widow just as I told you. Smoking-room yarn, is it? I bet I
      could pick out half a dozen men right in them chairs who could run the
      ship as well as he does. Maybe we'll have to take charge, after all&mdash;don't
      you think so, Mr. Bonner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Texan smiled grimly: &ldquo;I'll let you do the picking, Mr. Carhart&mdash;&rdquo;
       and with his hand on the Actor's arm, the two went below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A counter-current now swept through the ship. If anything was really the
      matter the Captain would not be dancing jigs, nor would he leave the
      bridge for his meals. This, like all other counter-currents&mdash;wave or
      otherwise&mdash;tossed up a bobble of dispute when the two clashed. There
      was no doubt about it: Carhart had been &ldquo;talking through his hat&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shooting
      off his mouth&rdquo;&mdash;the man was &ldquo;a gas bag,&rdquo; etc., etc. When appeal for
      confirmation was made to the Texan and the Actor, who now seemed
      inseparable, neither made reply. They evidently did not care to be mixed
      up in what Bonner characterized with a grim smile as &ldquo;more hot air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through the meal the Captain kept up his good-natured mood; chatting
      with the widow who sat on his right, the baby in her lap; making a pig of
      a lemon and some tooth-picks for the boy, who had crawled up into his
      arms; exchanging nods and smiles down the length of the table with several
      new arrivals, or congratulating those nearest to him on their recovery
      after the storm, ending by carrying both boy and baby to the upper deck&mdash;so
      that he might &ldquo;not forget how to handle&rdquo; his own when he got back, he
      laughed in explanation.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Luncheon over, the passengers, many of whom had been continuously in their
      berths, began to crowd the decks. These soon discovered that the ship was
      not on an even keel; a fact confirmed when attention was called to the
      slant of the steamer chairs and the roll of an orange toward the scuppers.
      Explanation was offered by the Texan, who argued that the wind had hauled,
      and being then abeam had given her a list to starboard. This, while not
      wholly satisfactory to the more experienced, allayed the fears of the
      women&mdash;there were two or three on board beside the widow&mdash;who
      welcomed the respite from the wrench and stagger of the previous hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention was now drawn by a nervous passenger to a gang of sailors under
      the First Officer, who were at work overhauling the boats on the forward
      deck, immediately under the eyes of the Captain who had returned to the
      bridge, as well as to an approaching wall of fog which, while he was
      speaking, had blanketed the ship, sending two of the boat gang on a run to
      the bow. The fog-horn also blew continuously, almost without intermission.
      Now and then it too would give three short, sharp snorts, as if of
      warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers had now massed themselves in groups, some touch of
      sympathy, or previous acquaintance, or trait of courage but recently
      discovered, having drawn them together. Again the Captain passed down the
      deck. This time he stopped to light a cigarette from a passenger's cigar,
      remarking as he did so that it was &ldquo;as thick as pea soup on the bridge,
      but he thought it would lighten before morning.&rdquo; Then halting beside the
      chair of an old lady who had but recently appeared on deck, he
      congratulated her on her recovery and kept on his way to the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow, however, was still anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing with the boats?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes following the
      Captain's disappearing figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only overhauling them, madam,&rdquo; spoke up the Texan, who had stationed
      himself near her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't that unusual!&rdquo; she inquired in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, just precaution, and always a safe one in a fog. Collision
      comes so quick sometimes they don't have time even to clear the davits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the sailors are carrying up boxes and kegs and putting them in the
      boats; what's that for?&rdquo; broke in another passenger, who had been leaning
      over the forward rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grub and water, I guess,&rdquo; returned the Texan. &ldquo;It's a thousand miles to
      the nearest land, and there ain't no bakery on the way that I know of.
      Can't be too careful when there's women and babies aboard, especially
      little fellows like these&mdash;&rdquo; and he ran his hand through the boy's
      curls. &ldquo;The Captain don't take no chances. That's what I like him for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the current of hope submerged the current of despair. The slant of
      the deck, however, increased, although the wind had gone down; so much so
      that the steamer chairs had to be lashed to the iron hand-hold skirting
      the wall of the upper cabins. So had the fog, which was now so dense that
      it hid completely the work of the boat gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the passing of the afternoon and the approach of night, thus
      deepening the gloom, there was added another and a new anxiety to the
      drone of the fog-horn. This was a Coston signal which flashed from the
      bridge, flooding the deck with light and pencilling masts and rigging in
      lines of fire. These flashes kept up at intervals of five minutes, the
      colors changing from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indefinable fear now swept through the vessel. The doubters and
      scoffers from the smoking-room who stood huddled together near the forward
      companion-way talked in whispers. The slant of the deck they argued might
      be due to a shift of the cargo&mdash;a situation serious, but not
      dangerous&mdash;but why burn Costons? The only men who seemed to be
      holding their own, and who were still calm and undisturbed, were the Texan
      and the Actor. These, during the conference, had moved toward the flight
      of steps leading to the bridge and had taken their positions near the
      bottom step, but within reach of the widow's chair. Once the Actor
      loosened his coat and slipped in his hand as if to be sure of something he
      did not want to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going on the Captain left the bridge in charge of the
      Second Officer and descended to his cabin. Reaching over his bunk, he
      unhooked the picture of his wife and child, tore it from its frame, looked
      at it intently for a moment, and then, with a sigh, slid it into an inside
      pocket. This done, he stripped off his wet storm coat, thrust his arms
      into a close-fitting reefing jacket, unhooked a holster from its place,
      dropped its contents into his outside pocket, and walked slowly down the
      flight of steps to where the Texan and the Actor stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, facing the passengers, and in the same tone of voice with which he
      would have ordered a cup of coffee from a steward, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, I find it necessary to abandon the ship. There is time enough
      and no necessity for crowding. The boats are provisioned for thirty days.
      The women and children will go first: this order will be literally carried
      out; those who disobey it will have to be dealt with in another way. This,
      I hope, you will not make necessary. I will also tell you that I believe
      we are still within the steamer zone, although the fog and weather have
      prevented any observation. Do you stay here, madam. I'll come for you when
      I am ready&mdash;&rdquo; and he laid his hand encouragingly on the widow's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he turned to the Texan and the Actor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, both of you, do you not, Mr. Bonner? You and your friend
      will guard the aft companion-way, and help the Chief Engineer take care of
      the stokers and the steerage. I and the First Officer will fill the
      boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of a panic is like the beginning of a fire: first a curl of
      smoke licking through a closed sash, then a rush of flame, and then a roar
      freighted with death. Its subduing is along similar lines: A sharp command
      clearing the way, concentrated effort, and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the curl of smoke was an agonized shriek from an elderly woman who
      fell fainting on the deck; the rush of flame was a wild surge of men
      hurling themselves toward the boats, and the roar which meant death was
      the frenzied throng of begrimed half-naked stokers and crazed emigrants
      who were wedged in a solid mass in the companion-way leading to the upper
      deck. The subduing was the same.
    </p>
    <p>

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/back-all-of-you.jpg" alt="Back, All of You " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, all of you!&rdquo; shouted the Engineer. &ldquo;The first man who passes that
      door without my permission I'll kill! Five of you at a time&mdash;no
      crowding&mdash;keep 'em in line, Mr. Bonner&mdash;you and your friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Texan and the Bum Actor were within three feet of him as he spoke&mdash;the
      Texan as cool as if he were keeping count of a drove of steers, except
      that he tallied with the barrel of a six-shooter instead of a note-book
      and pencil. The Bum Actor's face was deathly white and his pistol hand
      trembled a little, but he did not flinch. He ranged the lucky ones in line
      farther along, and kept them there. &ldquo;Anything to get home,&rdquo; he had told
      the Texan when he had slipped Bonner's other revolver, an hour before,
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the saloon deck the flame of fear was still raging, although the
      sailors and the three stewards were so many moving automatons under the
      First Officer's orders. The widow, with her baby held tight to her breast,
      had not moved from where the Captain had placed her, nor had she uttered a
      moan. The crisis was too great for anything but implicit obedience. The
      Captain had kept his word, and had told her when danger threatened; she
      must now wait for what God had in store for her. The boy stood by the
      First Officer; he had clapped his hands and laughed when he saw the first
      boat swung clear of the davits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carhart was the color of ashes and could hardly articulate. He had edged
      up close to the gangway where the boats were to be filled. Twice he had
      tried to wedge himself between the First Officer and the rail and twice
      had been pushed back&mdash;the last time with a swing that landed him
      against a pile of steamer chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the fog-horn had kept up its monotonous din, the Costons
      flaring at intervals. The stoppage of either would only have added to the
      terror now partly allayed by the Captain's encouraging talk, which was
      picked up and repeated all over the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first boat was now ready for passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, madam&mdash;you first&mdash;&rdquo; the Captain said to the widow.
      &ldquo;You must go alone with the baby, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. Something had caught his ear&mdash;something
      that made him lunge heavily toward the rail, his eyes searching the gloom,
      his hand cupped to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard, men!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Keep still-all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">

    </div>
    <p>
      Out of the stillness of the night came the moan of a distant fog-horn.
      This was followed by a wild cheer from the men at the boat davits. At the
      same instant a dim, far-away light cut its way through the black void,
      burned for a moment, and disappeared like a dying star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cheer went up. This time the watch on the foretop and the men
      astride the nose sent it whirling through the choke and damp with an added
      note of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain turned to the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's her&mdash;that's the <i>St. Louis!</i> I've been hoping for her
      all day, and didn't give up until the fog shut in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can stay here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;we haven't a moment to lose. Our fires are nearly out now. We've
      been in a sinking condition for forty-eight hours. We sprung a leak where
      we couldn't get at it, and our pumps are clogged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside, men! All ready, madam! No, you can't manage them both&mdash;give
      me the boy,&mdash;I'll bring him in the last boat.&rdquo;
